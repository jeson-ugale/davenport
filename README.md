## JESON'S REPOSITORY

### Friendly ML (Machine Learning)
User-friendly Python program that guides the user through the predictive modeling process. Covers supervised learning (regression, classification) and unsupervised learning (clustering, association rule learning). Automates simple data preprocessing, provides feature importances using random forests, assesses models with 10-fold cross validation, and automates hyperparameter tuning using the random search method.

This project caters to anyone in the range of 'completely code illiterate' to 'intermediate machine learning enthusiast'. The latter could easily modify the script to do more.

### Python/R Projects
Data analyses in various contexts. Mostly done through exploratory data analysis and data visualization.
