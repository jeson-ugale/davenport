# Jeson's Repo
With this repository, I will demonstrate my potential as a data analyst to you. My goal is to master Python, R, and SQL to have a strong foundation from which I can build upon.

My education is a Bachelor's of Science (Statistics) from the University of Toronto. My ongoing learning is primarily done through Udemy, an online learning platform. Below is a list of the courses I am currently taking:
