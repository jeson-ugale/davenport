## JESON'S REPOSITORY

### Friendly ML (Machine Learning)
Beginner-friendly Python script that guides the user through the predictive modeling process. Covers supervised learning (regression, classification) and unsupervised learning (clustering, association rule learning). Automates simple data preprocessing, provides feature importances using random forests, assesses models with 10-fold cross validation, automates hyperparameter tuning using the random search method.

### Python/R Projects
Data analyses in various contexts. Mostly done through exploratory data analysis and data visualization.
